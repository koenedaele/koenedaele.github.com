Last week I gave a talk at the [CAA2012 conference](http://caaconference.org/) in Southhampton. I talked about handling imperfect temporal information in data sets or databases. Storing things like "He was born in 1722" alongsides "She was born on the 4th of december 2004" and even "This happened somewhere aorund 1905" in a similar way and still being able to do something with all this information like analyze or query it.

Some of the possible ways of going about this work with Rough Time Intervals (a special case of a rough set) or Fuzzy Time Intervals (a special case of a fuzzy set).

I've uploaded my slides for this talk to [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/koenedaele/imperfect-temporal-information-in-data-sets).

Anyone who wants to know more about it can read the [masterpaper](http://lib.ugent.be/fulltxt/RUG01/001/418/820/RUG01-001418820_2010_0001_AC.pdf) I wrote on it or check out the [code](https://github.com/koenedaele/pgFTI) on Github.
