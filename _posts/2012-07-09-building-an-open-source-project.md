A few weeks ago I was at a meeting/seminar where we discussed a possible future 
IT project. This was a meeting that generally consisted of experts in cultural 
heritage. So, these were archaeologists, art and architectural historians and 
other mostly non-technical people. The hosting organisations 
are developping a system for managing cultural resources and had gathered some 
key players in the field to get their feedback on the proposed system and check 
if this was actually something people were waiting for.

Because they also want this to be a viable long-term project, the hosts have 
decided that this project could benefit from being open source. Something which 
I find to be self-evident. Of course, for most people in cultural heritage this 
is not so self-evident. A lot of them don''t know what exactly open source is 
(although most of them have heard about it in some form) or have mainly picked 
up some of the typical FUD. My favourite quote went something like this: 
 
 * Our IT department says we can''t use open source. It''s againt policy.
 * Why?
 * Because they can''t sue anybody if something goes wrong.

This meeting being held in the USA might have also had something to do with that.

To illustrate what open source is, why it might be beneficial and how you could 
build a community around such a software project, the hosts brought in a consultant. 
In two presentations he explained what software actually is (a bunch of code), 
what open source software is, what a vcs is, why you need a bugtracker, 
a wiki, good documentation, a mailing list, etc... 
I was most impressed when he actually succeeded in explaining 
what a patch is, what a diff looks like and how it can be used in a 
open source project.

Most of the things he talked about were more or less familiar to me, but it was
nice getting a summary and a recap of *all there is to know about open source 
software*. We were all handed a copy of a [book] the consultant wrote on managing an 
open source project. I found it to be a very interesting read, although it was 
a bit dated on a few technical issues (eg. svn was still the go-to vcs when 
the book was written.). He did assure me that a new version was being worked on.

What really sold me on this book was the attention paid to the soft stuff. Things
like how do you get people involved in your project, how do you keep them 
motivated, how do you keep things running smoothly, ... All in all it focused 
very much on the social nature of open source software. I think it''s must read 
and I would definately recommend it to anyone thinking of starting an open 
source project or even anyone just interested in joining one.
